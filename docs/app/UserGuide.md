## Understanding the Bonding Curve

The LORE token uses a bonding curve mechanism, which means:

- Token price increases as more tokens are purchased
- Token price decreases as tokens are sold back to the curve
- The price is determined mathematically by the current supply

This creates a liquid market where tokens can always be bought or sold at a price determined by the curve.

## Slippage Protection

When making transactions, you can set a slippage tolerance to protect against price movements between the time your transaction is submitted and when it's confirmed on the blockchain.

Higher slippage tolerance increases the chance of your transaction succeeding during volatile market conditions, but may result in less favorable prices.

## Transaction Fees

All transactions on the Ethereum network require gas fees. The application will display the estimated gas fees before you confirm transactions.
