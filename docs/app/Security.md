# Security Guide

This document outlines security considerations for both users and developers of the LORE Token Sale application.

## User Security Recommendations

### Wallet Security

1. **Use a Hardware Wallet**: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor
2. **Check Wallet Connections**: Regularly review and revoke unnecessary wallet connections
3. **Verify Transactions**: Always verify transaction details before signing, including:
   - Token amounts
   - ETH amounts
   - Gas fees
   - Contract address
4. **Use Trusted Browser Extensions**: Only install wallet extensions from official sources

### Transaction Security

1. **Set Appropriate Slippage**: Choose slippage tolerance based on market volatility
2. **Start with Small Amounts**: Test the platform with small transactions first
3. **Check Contract Addresses**: Verify that you're interacting with legitimate contracts
4. **Review Gas Settings**: Be aware of gas fees and settings, especially during network congestion

### Account Security

1. **Never Share Private Keys**: No legitimate service will ask for your private keys or seed phrase
2. **Use a Strong Password**: If using a software wallet, ensure it's protected with a strong password
3. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Use 2FA wherever available for your wallet or exchange accounts
4. **Be Wary of Phishing**: Access the application only through official links

## Smart Contract Security

Our bonding curve implementation includes several security features:

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: All state-changing functions are protected against reentrancy attacks
2. **Slippage Protection**: Built-in slippage parameters protect against front-running
3. **Input Validation**: Extensive validation of input parameters prevents unexpected behavior
4. **Access Control**: Administrative functions are protected by ownership validation
5. **Emergency Pause**: The contract can be paused in emergency situations

For more technical details, see the [Security Considerations for BondingCurve](../contracts/SecurityConsiderations.md) document.

## Application Security Features

### Network Validation

The application verifies that users are connected to the correct network:

1. Detects current network
2. Warns if using an unsupported network
3. Provides guidance for switching to the correct network

### Transaction Safeguards

Several safeguards protect users during transactions:

1. **Pre-transaction validation**: Checks balances and approvals before submitting transactions
2. **Slippage control**: User-configurable slippage tolerance
3. **Transaction confirmation**: Clear confirmation steps before signing
4. **Transaction monitoring**: Real-time status updates for pending transactions

### Data Integrity

To ensure data integrity:

1. **Data verification**: Critical data is verified against multiple sources when possible
2. **Checksums**: Contract addresses are validated using checksums
3. **Error handling**: Clear error messages for data inconsistencies

## Known Limitations

Users should be aware of these inherent limitations:

1. **Front-running risk**: Despite slippage protection, MEV (Miner Extractable Value) remains a risk on public blockchains
2. **Gas price volatility**: High network congestion can lead to increased transaction costs
3. **Price impact**: Large transactions can significantly impact the token price due to the bonding curve mechanism
4. **Block confirmation times**: Transaction finality depends on blockchain confirmation times

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose publicly**: Avoid sharing the vulnerability on public forums
2. **Contact the team**: Email security@loreum.org with details
3. **Provide details**: Include steps to reproduce and potential impact
4. **Responsible disclosure**: Allow time for fixes before public disclosure

## Security Audits

The LORE Token contracts have undergone security audits:

1. Internal team review
2. External audit by [Audit Firm] (completed on [Date])
3. Formal verification of critical functions

Audit reports are available at [Security Reports Link].

## Emergency Procedures

In case of emergency (e.g., discovered vulnerability, exploit):

1. The contract may be paused by administrators
2. Users will be notified through official channels
3. An incident response team will address the issue
4. Regular updates will be provided until resolution

## Best Practices for Developers

For developers working with this codebase:

1. **Environment Security**: Use secure environment variables for sensitive information
2. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update and audit dependencies
3. **Testing**: Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all changes
4. **Code Review**: Ensure all code changes undergo peer review
5. **Minimal Privileges**: Follow principle of least privilege for all integrations
