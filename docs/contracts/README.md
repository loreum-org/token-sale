# LORE Token Sale Smart Contracts Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the LORE token sale smart contracts. This documentation provides detailed explanations of the contract architecture, functionality, and usage guidelines.

## Contracts Overview

The LORE token sale uses a bonding curve mechanism to provide a fair, transparent, and predictable token price determination. The system consists of the following key components:

### [BondingCurve](./BondingCurve.md)
The main contract that implements the polynomial bonding curve for token sales. It manages:
- ETH reserves and token distribution
- Dynamic price calculation based on supply
- Buy/sell functionality with slippage protection
- Administrative controls for contract management

## Architecture

The contract system follows a modular design with:

1. **Core Contracts**: Implementation of the bonding curve mechanics
2. **Interfaces**: Clearly defined interfaces for external interaction
3. **Access Control**: Owner-based permissions for administrative functions
4. **Security Features**: Reentrancy protection, slippage checks, and emergency controls

## Getting Started

For developers and administrators looking to interact with the contracts:

1. Start with the [BondingCurve](./BondingCurve.md) documentation to understand the main functionality
2. Review the function reference for detailed API information
3. Follow the best practices for contract management and maintenance
4. Use the [DeploymentGuide](./DeploymentGuide.md) for step-by-step instructions on deploying to different networks
